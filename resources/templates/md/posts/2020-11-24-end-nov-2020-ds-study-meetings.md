In the last two weekends, we have started a habit of weekend study meetings, with two groups that will meet interchangeably.

Every two weekends, we will have study sessions on machine learning and data science practices. This habit started for the first time with [the mid-November ML study meetings](../2020-10-29-nov-2020-ml-study-meetings). On the other weekends, we will have study sessions of the "Scicloj foundations", where we will be learning to become contributors to the emerging ecosystem of Clojure data science and the libraries and tools around it. This habit started for the first time with [the meetings last weekend](../2020-11-11-nov-2020-fundamentals-study-meetings).

We encourage you to follow these two groups on the corresponding Zulip streams: [#ml-study](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study) and [#sci-fu](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/265544-sci-fu).

In the coming last weekend of November, we will have a few more meetings of the first kind. They will vary in their content. In some of them, we will experiment with various tools and ways of learning together.

## Plan

### Data visualizations practice
- **Plan**: We will explore a data problem with an emphasis on data visualizations.
- **Workflow**: We will share a joint REPL session on a remote machine with our local editors. We will switch hands from time to time.
- **Facilitated by**: TBA and Daniel Slutsky
- **Time**: [13:00 27 Nov 2020 in UTC](https://time.is/1300_27_Nov_2020_in_UTC/)

### NLP session
- **Plan**: We will explore an NLP data problem
- **Facilitated by**: Jake Nylund
- **Time**: [18:00 27 Nov 2020 in UTC](https://time.is/1800_27_Nov_2020_in_UTC)

### ETL practice
- **Plan**: We will explore a data problem with an emphasis on ETL data processing.
- **Workflow**: Everybody will edit the same code using VSCode's remote abilities in a mob coding fashion.
- **Facilitated by**: J
- **Time**: [18:00 28 Nov 2020 in UTC](https://time.is/1800_28_Nov_2020_in_UTC/)

### Tweaking Notespace
- **Plan**: We will learn about [Notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) from the point of view of extending and tweaking it. We will also discuss some possible directions for our next steps in building literate programming solutions.
- **Workflow**: A talk, a discussion, and some hacking together.
- **Facilitated by**: Daniel Slutsky
- **Time**: [12:00 29 Nov 2020 in UTC](https://time.is/1200_29_Nov_2020_in_UTC/)

Please register in advance as much as possible, and let us know if anything changes your plans. This will help a lot in the preparations.

See you there!


## Q&A

**Q:** Can I go to any of the meetings?

**A:** Yes. Each of the meetings this weekend is self-contained and different.

**Q:** What should I do to participate?

**A:**
- Please fill in the [registration form](https://tinyurl.com/yywcw272) a few days in advance. Please [let us know](https://scicloj.github.io/pages/about/#where) about any changes in your plans.
- Please join the [#data-science stream of the Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) and follow the updates there towards the meetings. Please present yourself at the ['hello' topic thread](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/hello).
- Please join the [#ml-study stream](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study) as well, and say [hello](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/264992-ml-study/topic/hello).

**Q:** How long are the meetings?

**A:**
- Each of the study meetings will be 2 hours long.

**Q:** Are the meetings beginner-friendly?

**A:**
- Not exactly. At the moment, we are studying tools and libraries which are still changing and breaking. Sometimes, they are not entirely documented. Looking into them may require an open mind and might not be easy.
- However, we do assume that nobody in the meetings is an expert. We will seek clarity and will make an effort to help each other.
- After the ecosystem matures a bit more, we will organize workshops that are much more beginner-friendly.

**Q:** What knowledge will be assumed?

**A:**
- We will assume basic knowledge of Clojure (say, at least chapters 1,3,4,5 of Daniel Higginbotham's ["Clojure for the Brave and True"](https://www.braveclojure.com/)).
- In this weekend, we will not assume any specific background in data science concepts.

**Q:** What platform will we use for the meetings?

**A:**
- We will use Zoom for the video meetings. We will email you the Zoom link.
- We will use the Clojurians Zulip chat for our notes and textual discussions. Here is some recommended background about our use of Zulip: https://scicloj.github.io/pages/chat_streams/

**Q:** Will the meetings be recorded and published?

**A:**
- Usually, our study meetings are recorded, but the recordings are not shared publicly, but rather shared in our internal chat streams for our internal use.
- This time, some of the meetings may be published for wider audiences. This will be mentioned in the beginning of the meetings.
